# Plan 
Focus on OS dev stuff first, come back to hardware focused things later 

1. Do section 1, take notes. Should take a day. 

2. Code an assembler (should take ~week)
    - Come back to the CPU, needs to be rather complex to handle running the OS 

3. Do compiler, linked, libc + malloc (~ month or so)

    - Maybe do ethernet and bootloader 

4. Build OS, FAT, init, shell, download, cat, ls, rm. (~2 months or so?)

    - Use xv6-riscv as reference 
    - Come back to MMU and SD card 

5. Browser (~month or so)
    - Dynamic linking, web browser 
    - Maybe do telnetd and TCP stack 

6. Do section 2, take notes. Should take ~week 
7. Hardware stuff
